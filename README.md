## Music App

A web application where users can upload their own songs, create playlists and listen to other users uploaded songs.

## Tech-stack

The project uses:
- .NET 9 for the backend
- React for the frontend
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Neon for the database provider
- CloudFlare R2 for storing songs
- SonarQube for static code analysis
- Contabo for VPS
- k6 for load/performance testing
- TestCafe for end-to-end browser testing

## Architecture

Frontend (React):
  - Handles user interactions, authentication, and playlist management.
  - Communicates with the backend via REST APIs endpoints.
  - Provides updates for song uploads, playlist changes, and streaming progress.

Backend (.NET 9):
  - Serves as the API layer, managing authentication, authorization, and business logic.
  - Handles file uploads for songs and stores metadata in the database.

Database (PostgreSQL):
  - Stores user data, playlists, song metadata, and relationships between users and content.
  - Optimized with indexes for search queries and supports relational integrity for playlists and song ownership.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests. It consists of the following stages:

1. **Build** — Restores, builds, and tests the .NET backend. Runs SonarQube static code analysis and generates a code coverage report.

2. **Deploy DB** — Bundles and applies Entity Framework migrations. On `main` the production database is targeted; on other branches, the staging database is used.

3. **Deploy App** *(main only)* — Builds and pushes Docker images for the API and client to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), creates a GitHub release with auto-generated notes, and deploys to the VPS via SSH.

4. **VPS Smoke Tests** *(main only, after deploy)* — Runs automated tests against the live VPS to verify the deployment:
   - **TestCafe** end-to-end tests (`testcafe/home_test.js`, `testcafe/upload_song_test.js`) using Firefox headless. Screenshots are uploaded as artifacts on failure.
   - **k6** load tests (`k6/auth_test.js`, `k6/song_test.js`) against the API on port 8080. Before running, the VPS is switched to the staging database; after completion, the production database is restored.

### k6 Load Tests

| Test file | Scenarios | Key thresholds |
|---|---|---|
| `k6/auth_test.js` | Login load (up to 10 VUs), token refresh load (up to 20 VUs) | `http_req_failed < 4%`, login p95 < 2 s, refresh p95 < 500 ms |
| `k6/song_test.js` | Public song listing (up to 10 VUs), authenticated song access (up to 20 VUs) | `http_req_failed < 1%`, getSongs p95 < 500 ms, signed URL p95 < 400 ms |

### TestCafe E2E Tests

| Test file | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `testcafe/home_test.js` | Home page loads and songs are visible |
| `testcafe/upload_song_test.js` | Authenticated user can upload a song |

## Agentic Workflows

The repository includes three GitHub Copilot agentic workflows that run on a daily schedule:

- **Daily Repo Status** (`.github/workflows/daily-repo-status.md`) — Gathers recent repository activity (issues, PRs, code changes) and creates a GitHub issue with a status report, highlights, and recommended next steps.

- **Daily Documentation Updater** (`.github/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md`) — Scans merged pull requests and commits from the last 24 hours, identifies undocumented changes, and opens a pull request to update the documentation.

- **Code Simplifier** (`.github/workflows/code-simplifier.md`) — Analyzes recently modified code and creates pull requests with simplifications that improve clarity, consistency, and maintainability while preserving functionality.
